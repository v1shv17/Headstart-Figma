# Figma Prototype

## Overview
This was my first hackathon, where I learned Figma, created a business plan, and presented it in front of a panel. I secured second place in the event. This Figma prototype showcases the UI/UX design for An application dedicated to empowering immigrant talent in reaching their full potential through data analytics and AI.
